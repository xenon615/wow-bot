# My implementation  of World of Warcraft bots
## Fisher
### Usage
Run WOW.
Choose a fishing spot
It is desirable that in the field of view there are no red and blue objects and white objects, such as splashes, otherwise the bobber and splash may be found falsely.
In some cases, you can comment out the blue or red color set in INI file.

Set the first person view so that the items of equipment do not interfere with the search for the float. 
Place the fishing spell on the first button of the command bar.
Take a fishing rod in your hand (if desired, attach a bait)
Run the script.

If the float search area is not defined, the script will prompt you to select the upper left and lower right corners of the area. After that, the script will circle it with the mouse for visual control and throw the fishing rod. When a bobber feather is found, the mouse pointer will move to it and wait for a splash.
Use F6 and  F7 to decrease or increase the sensitivity of the bobber search, respectively.
The same for splash with ALT key pressed

####  The script is not intended for dishonorable enrichment (although who is a saint here? ;) ) and is published for informational and demonstration purposes
